Week 5 5/28/18 - 6/1/18
	Monday 5/28/18 ~ 0 Hours
		Memorial Day
	Tuesday 5/29/18 ~ 6 Hours
		Created a new project in Wit, called PRYDE, that will serve as the actual chat-bot
			Created trait entities for questions, field related problems, closure related problems, and form related problems
				These will be used to determine what kind of issue that the user is having
				The chat-bot will then decide how to handle the information given and may request more information
			Created a free-text/keyword entity named 'forms'
				This will help determine what form that the user is talking about
					Eventually, we will make the chat-bot figure out which form they are already on automatically
						Along with their name and other available information
			Spent a good amount of time training these entities for later usage
				Training by adding examples to the Wit API to test how the chat-bot will understand a sentence
	Wednesday 5/30/18 ~ 4 Hours
		Created a flow chart for figuring out the path of logic that the chat-bot will take
			Starts with figuring out if they are asking a question or posing a problems
			If they are posing a problems
				Figure out what form is the issue
				Figure out which fields are not complete
					or which fields are known to give problems to the user
						pull these fields from the database
				Figure out the field name
				Figure out commmon answers for these problem fields
				Formulate a response
				Figure out if the response helps the user or not
					If so, we have achieved our goal
					If not, loop  back through the flow chart
						or contact support internally via a database entry
		Showed Ben my flowchart that I made
			He agreed with how I want to set up the process flow
				Notifying support internally will allow us to fix issues that are too complex for the chat-bot to solve
				We need to be able to train the chat-bot to access known field problems and how to resolve them
			Gave me insight as to what kinds of questions and/or problems that the user may pose
			Our plan is to be able to get the problematic form name from their current position
		Started training fields on specific forms on Wit
			I focused on fields that can pose a problem from my point of view
				Such as SSN, birth-date, and signature fields
	Thursday 5/31/18 ~ 5 Hours
		Started changing some of the entities that I made on Wit
			Made it so that the API will look for general problems or questions
				instead of looking for specific problems
			Trained these entities so that I can use them once I create the code to handle inputs
		Put together a simple script as a starting point
			Recieves user input and determines whether they are posing a problem or asking a question
			Then it determines what kind of problem they are having: a field problem, 
				a form closure problem, a form opening problem or other
			If they are having a field problem, it determines what kind of problem: a locked field, an unvalidated field or other
	Friday 6/1/18 ~ 3 Hours
		Continued training Wit
			This will be an ongoing sub-project as it needs to recognize all input regardless of how it is phrased
		Created a method stub that will grab the name of the form that the user is on
			A goal of mine is to be able to grab all empty fields on the form so the chat-bot knows what it is looking for
