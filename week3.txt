Week 3 5/14/18 - 5/18/18
	Monday 5/14/18 ~ 4 Hours
		Talked with Ben about our goals for the week
			Since my test chat-bots already have a way of changing conversation, 
				we wanted to get another API for creating sentences so that conversation feels natural (as if a robot was not doing it)
			Are goal for the entire project is to be able to have our co-workers train the chat-bot so that they
				can pick a topic themselves and talk about it
		Unsuccessfully attempted to find an API that would handle generating sentences that would feel natural
			Most API's online that are for natural language processing create fake text with no general or constant topic
				This is unappealing since we want our chatbot to talk about a topic that we give it
		Started writing my own sentence generator that may or not be used in the final product
			Started with greetings and re-greetings (once a user has been welcomed into the system,
				they are no longer greeted; instead they are 'remembered' and asked if they need help
	Tuesday 5/15/18 ~ 2 Hours
		I was extremely busy today with my normal work duties, so I didn't spend a long time working on the chat-bot
		Ben wanted me to continue searching for a natural sentence generator
			Still came up with nothing that would fulfill our needs
				However I learned about the basic components of NLP (natural language processing)
					How machines 'learn' and 'think' via experience aka training
	Wednesday 5/16/18 ~ 5 Hours
		Once I discussed my difficulties finding an API that would handle natural language procesing with Ben,
			he guided me into the direction of natural language generation (NLG)
			NLP is essentially a component of AI which takes a user input and determining what they are talking about
			NLG is essentially a component of AI which creates a response to the user based on the user input and/or data
		Found a couple of API's that could potentially work for our purposes
			SimpleNLG/SimplerNLG
			Wordsmith
			Both were API's for Ruby
		Wordsmith had little-to-no documentation and I couldn't figure out how to sign up or log in to the system
		SimpleNLG had some documentation and had a plethora of examples
	Thursday 5/17/18 ~ 4 Hours
		Continued researching SimpleNLG, its examples and usage
			Had to perform research for some linguistics terminology and definitions. Used google and youtube
				The difference between being the subject of a sentence and the object of a sentence
					The subject is the person/thing that is doing something
					The object is having something done to it
				What is a subject complement
					Follows a linking verb and modifies or refers to the subject
						An action verb is a verb that describes an action
						A linking verb is a verb that connects the subject of the sentence to information about that subject
				Including passive voice, progressive form and perfect tense
					Perfect tense are verb tenses which show action already completed
					Passive voice is used to show interest in the object of the sentence rather than the subject of the sentence
					Progressive form shows that an action is still in progress
						Verbs can be in present, past or future progressive
				Who vs Whom
					Who is the subject ofa a verb (the one doing the action)
					Whom is the object of a verb (the one being acted upon)
		I was given permission to use SimpleNLG for our NLG purposes
	Friday 5/18/18 ~ 8 Hours
		After attempting to add a ruby gem for SimpleNLG, I realized that my virtual machine still did not have enough disk space
		Successfully increased the VM size
			Unfortunately, this was the easy part. Trying to change the VM partition size was another story
				Tried to mount an ISO for Gparted - a GUI tool to change the disk partition of a linux OS
					My VM's GUI is still messed up - even though I can SSH into the VM
				Finally I found a non-GUI tool, Parted, which allowed me to change the partition size via commmand line
		Finally I have enough space on my VM to update files, which means i can add the ruby gem for SimpleNLG
			However, our network was down at the end of the day so I wasn't able to perform 'bundle install'
				which would install my new ruby gem
