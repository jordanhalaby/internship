Week 8 6/18/18 - 6/22/18
	Monday 6/18/18
		Talked to Jessica about potential questions and problems that users of our system run into frequently
			She said that the biggest problems have to do with the I9 form and its related forms
				I9 Supporting Documents
					Useres don't know to upload the front and back of their documents
						These include their drivers license, SS card, and birth certificate
				I9 Authorized Representative Information
					The Agent Representative Information section asks for a user to input a representative
						Their name, valid e-mail address, and must be over 18 years old
			There are also miscellaneous problems that users run into
				Direct Deposit Documentation
					Must be a typed letter from the bank
						This is because a written letter may be read falsely and has potential for linking to the wrong bank account
				Withholdings forms
					User may work in one state and live in another
			Questions that users run into
				How to sign/save a signature
				How to view/print a PDF
				How to do things regarding Fieldglass
					Fieldglass User Guide
			Whether they are using Internet Explorer in contrast to Chrome/Firefox
		Wrote down my plan for the rest of the week
			Going to continue interviewing people about their common problems
			Mess around with the training data on my Java implementation of the neural network
			Comment my code so that I can see what is going on with more clarity and without reading the code itself
			*Find the range of an output value to map it to a real response
			Add code to automatically create the database and a collection if they don't exist
	Tuesday 6/19/18
		Talked with Candace, who is our Independent Contractor specialist, mostly about her view of common questions
			For the E-Verify Self Check Instructions, there are 2 frequently asked questions
				Why does it need to be done
					Per company policy, checks to see if the individual is eligible to work in the United States
				Where do I upload
					The Self Check Results item
			For the Self Check Results, people often ask what to upload
				A picture of the green checkmark that confirms the work authorization
			For the Electronic Fund Transfer Authorization
				We want to ask the user if they are interested in receiving direct deposit
					If so, we want them to click the "New EFT Account" box
			For the certificate of insurance, people often ask who the certificate holder should be
				The answer is the name of our company, Commoneo, and our address
			For the Business Director Listing, users often say that they don't advertise in Yellowpages
				We should give examples such as Facebook, LinkedIn, etc
			For the IC customer list, people often ask why they need to fill it out
				This list helps to substantiate the IC's validity as an IC in the case of an IRS audit
			The equipment list has 3 frequently asked questions
				Why do you need this? should be answered by "It helps differentiate your status as an IC as opposed to a W2"
				What do you need here? should be a listing of any equipment that you bring with you on-site during a project
				I don't have any equipment? should be answered by "is there anything that you take on-site"
		After talking to Candace, I talked to Lynette, who is another one of our workers who deal with W2 workers being onboarded
			She brought to my attention a client specific form called "HPE Assignment Checklist"
				For the following question on the form: Has the contractor beeen an HP/HPE employee within the past 12 months
					The worker should only answer 'yes' if they were a W2 worker during that time
				Conversely: Has the contractor previously worked at HP/HPE as a contractor
					This only applies if they were an IC at that time
			For the JPMC EJC Application Instructions there are 3 common questions
				"What is the code?" (Referring to the code to get into the application)
					JPMCCW (Highlighted in red on the item)
				"How do i log back in?"
					Go to applicationstation.com, and use your previosu username and password
				"How do i get the verification of the completed application
					Log in, and go to the link to view your completed application
			She also brought up a good idea of drawing attention to the field that we are talking
				I will have to talk with Ben about possibilities for this
	Wednesday 6/20/18
		Talked to Brittani, who is the general W2 onboarding consultant
			She told me that for the I9 Authorized Representative Information form, people commonly ask if they can use themselves
				The answer to that is no, also the instruction verbage is weird
			For the Hourly Consultant Benefits Waiver, people ask exactly what they are waiving
				This is basically saying that any benefit that you are eligible for come from VSG and not from the client
			For the Sick Leave Notice item, in order to tell if people get benefits, they need to scroll down to their state on the item
			For the I9 Form itself, a common question is why they can't fill out the 2nd page
				That is for the employer to fill out
			She was very adament that people don't read instructions to the full extent required
		As a group, we decided that if the chat-bot fails to help the user, they will be redirected to the general HR number
		I continued working on my Java implementation of the neural network
			Commented my code so that I can easily understand what is going on when i begin converting it to Ruby
			Started playing around with the training file 
				Learned that I can only use values between 0 and 1 for this specific algorithm
					So all codes will have to be converted to a decimal and then converted back to an integer later
	Thursday 6/21/18
		Since this chat-bot will be deployed on the development server before being transfered to the production server,
			I found it necessary to create a few commands in Ruby that will automatically create the database and collection(s) that are necessary
			This was done by simply creating a mongo connection with the new database name declared, and creating a collection with the	
				create_collection command
			This will allow for a smooth transitioning from the development server to the production server
		Changed the method that saves user input so that not only does it store the input in the database, 
			but it also saves the name of the form
			Changed the debugger method so that it spits out the input and the form name
