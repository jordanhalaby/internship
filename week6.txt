Week 6 6/4/18 - 6/8/18
	Monday 6/4/18 ~ 3 Hours
		Starting from where I left off last week with responses that are based on
			which form and/or field that is having problems, I began to integrate the SimpleNLG API into 
			my new chat-bot application (PRYDE) so that responses are formulated in a way so
			that they semi-natural
		Implemented a new greetings feature so that sampling from multiple arrays forms a new
			sentence that will not be consistently the same, aka it's method output varies
			Also implemented a re-greeting method that will 'remember' that the user has already
				been welcomed to the system
		Finally, i copied over the code from my test chat-bot that will either save, remove, or update
			how a phrase should be processed instead of what Wit processed it as
				This will require a database integration and will allow for us as a company to train it
	Tuesday 6/5/18 ~ 4 Hours
		Today our company changed our office location to an area that was more spacious
			This was because ouir company is growing rapidly and our old office didn't have enough space/resources
			Upon booting up our computers, we realized that our internet was not working the way it was supposed to
				Among others, i was unable to connect to the VPN and therefore was unable to continue developing the chat-bot for the day
		So, in order to actually acomplish something with my chat-bot, i began to further research NoSQL, SQL, their similarities and differences
			Having taken both database principles and Big Data, I was very familiar and comfortable with SQL
			NoSQL on the other hand is foreign to me, so I researched about
				Collections, documents
				Insert, update, find, count, aggregate, and remove operations
			Essium uses MongoDB as their database utility, so learning NoSQL and SQL is of paramount importance
	Wednesday 6/6/18 ~ 4 Hours
		When Joel brought it to my attention that i could lose all of the progress that I have made on the
			chat-bot if something were to happen to my laptop
			Therefore, he suggested that I upload all of my code to github regularly so that this problem will be nonexistent
			So today I started to learn Github as I have no prior knowledge of it
				I learned about:
					git init
					git add (for one or several files)
					git commit
					git remmote add origin 
					git push -u origin master
				I had to create an SSH key and add it to Github in order for pushing to work
		Talked to Ben about future implementation goals
			I want to integrate my chat-bot with MongoDB so that I can train the chat-bot
				My thinking is to go to each person in the office and ask what kinds of problems that users run into
			I also want to give the chat-bot a GUI so that I can start grabbing information such as user's name
				the current form that they are in, and fields that have yet to be completed
	Thursday 6/7/18 ~ 4 Hours
		Cleaned up some of my code so that it conforms to our current code standards
		Added comments to my existing code
			I wanted to make sure that whoever looks at my code will be able to understand what is going on with Wit
				and simpleNLG.
			This will be done consistently from now on
		Edited the logic used to save, update, or remove user input to the Wit API
			I made a method that will use database implementation so that the process of doing so will be easier and more efficient
	Friday 6/8/18 ~ 5 Hours
		Continued working on my flowchart by brainstorming possible questions that might be asked to the chat-bot
			Examples
				What documents are required for the I9 Form
				How does a user store their signature for later use
				Why are fields red
			Some of these questions could also be construed as problems, so there will be overlap
		Came up with a way to handle mapping user input to output
			I'm going to use a neural network so that i can classify user input as different responses
