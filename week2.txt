Week 2 5/7/18 - 5/11/18
	Monday 5/7/18 ~ 2 hours
		Made small adjustments to my test application
			Put in a method stub to get user name and option to save invalid entries
		Attempted to train the bot to tell what day/time that it currently is
			Wit comes with built-in entities for things like datetime, greetings, locations, etc
	Tuesday 5/8/18 ~ 5 hours
		Fixed an error in my test application
			When getting a joke from the user whose topic was not defined in the joke categories
			Wit was assuming that it was a category
				Therefore my application was looking for a joke whose topic was not made into a joke
				Fixed this by checking the list of jokes for the category that was entered
		Gave Ben a demo of my progress thus far
			Told me that I am on the right track
			He gave explained what I should attempt with my test application
		Added new features to the test application	
			Making sure that after the user says 'hello', the system remembers them
			Making sure that they user doesn't respond to a joke before it has been told
			Added a variable that tells which application is running.
				In this case, jokebot
	Wednesday 5/9/18 ~ 4 hours
		Spent far too much time installing mongodb on my virtual machine
			Kept getting an "connection refused" error
			Solved by editing the mongodb.conf file
		Learned about NoSQL having no prior knowledge
			Learned basic syntax
	Thursday 5/10/18 ~ 6 hours
		My development environment on my virtual machine got messed up
			I was unable to SSH into the machine
			After spending quite a long time with Ben, we realized that my host-only adapter was messed up
			Eventually was able to SSH into my machine
		I continued working on my test chat-bot
			Implemented a new class called topics
				Purpose of this was to keep track of which topics the user is talking about
					Useful for real chat-bot because we need to know which form/field the user is talking about
			Ran out of space on my virtual machine
				Spent time trying to determine which folders to remove in order to save my code
	Friday 5/11/18 ~ 3 hours
		Did more work on the topic chat-bot and came up with goals for next week
		My plan for next week is to connect to a Mongo database
			For chat responses that don't match with my given intent
				I am going to implement a save feature to write that response to the database
				I am also going to create a user interface for saving responses to the Wit API
			Talked to Ben about these plans and was told that it will be quite a process to do so
		Tested my virtual machine to make sure that it was correctly configured after yesterday's chaos
