Week 11 7/9/18 - 7/13/18
	Monday 7/9/18
		Started typing up the code for a decision tree in Java in order to get familiarized with the algorithm
		Took notes on things that will be important to remember when converting the Java code to Ruby
			There is an excessive use of ArrayLists which will be difficult to keep track of
			There are two inner classes that need to be defined
				Each with a plethora of private variables
			There are methods that return objects and arrays/arraylists instead of variables
			Many nested methods/functions that span throughout the whole algorithm
			Some arrays/arraylists need to be reset at certain points of the algorithm
