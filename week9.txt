Week 9 6/25/18 - 6/29/18
	Monday 6/25/18
		After having finishedd talking with the customer serviced representatives in the office last week,
		I am finally able to start training the Wit API so that it responds correctly to various input
		from the user
			I started going through all of the problems that I was provided with and started sorting them
				according to what kinds of questions that they provoke
				according to what specific form that these questions correspond to
				according to general problems that users face when using our system
			While writing out these questions, i realized that it is possible that the user will make statements instead of asking questions
				This meant that i would have to accomodate for these statments as best i can
		When i begin training the Wit API, I will have to use these questions and any other questions related to it
			For that reason, I am going to approach this task with great precison so as to avoid training the API falsely
			Also, I will have to be very repetitive with training Wit so that it understands as many ways as possible that 
				a question may be asked
		After i finish that, I will begin to formulate the answers to these questions and see if there are any similarities
			between these answers so tha the neural network has to perform less work
		At the end of the day, i had compiled a list of questions and their corresponding forms
	Tuesday 6/26/18
		I started going through the list of questions that pertain to their corresonding forms
			I formulated answers that not only answer the question, but also "use the question to answer the question"
			After formulating all of the answers, I grouped them according to similarities between other questions
				This will make it easier to create SimpleNLG sentences based off the incoming user input
			The most difficult part about this process was creating responses that not only answered the question,
			but also could be reused for other questions
		Tomorrow, i will begin to convert all of these sentences into SimpleNLG output
	Wednesday 6/27/18
		From the list of responses that I compiled yesterday, I began going through each one, one-by-one 
			I converted each of the responses to a SimpleNLG format 
				Had to figure out the subject, verb, and object of each responses
					Some of these required modifiers to the statements
			This took an extremely long time due to the nature of the task
				A lot of responses
				Having to re-learn several things about the SimpleNLG software
				Testing
			Instead of using the console to test, i use interactive ruby (IRB) with putty and copied and pasted each 
				SimpleNLG script into it so that i could test each one on the fly
	Thursday 6/28/18
		Spent a good majority of the day taking the questions given to me by our customer service representatives 
		and training Wit with them
			This took a long time for several reasons
				The list of my compiled questions was very long
				I had to take each question that i recorded and train Wit on it
					Then i had to take all questions (to the extent of my creativity) and devise different ways to phrase it
				Each of the questions required a subset of the following
					A new intent
					A new trait
					A new keyword
					At the end of my training, I had about 30 intents that were all devised to describe a users question
				I had to think creatively to address each question in its entirity
	Friday 6/29/18
		Now that I've trained Wit on statements and questions, the next step is to train it on common problems	
			These include items not opening, fields not validating, and other problems
			Similarly to training the Wit API with questions, this was a long process
				I had to essentially go through all of the potential problems that a user may encounter
		After training the Wit API on both questions, statements, and potential problems, I think i am ready
			to start converting intents into codes that can be used to train a neural network
			The neural network will be converted from Java to Ruby next week
